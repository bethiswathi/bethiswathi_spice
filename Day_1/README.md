# ðŸš€ CMOS Fundamentals

## What is SPICE?
- **SPICE** stands for **Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis**
- It's a **circuit simulation tool** which is now an industry standard for analyzing electronic circuits.
- There are many versions and extensions of SPICE (like **Ngspice, LTspice, PSpice etc), but they all serve the same core purpose.

## Why do we need SPICE simulations?
- Fabricating ICs is costly and time-consuming, so designers use **simulation tools** to explore and verify designs before fabrication.
- Simulations are inexpensive and operate at different **levels of abstraction**:

   - **Process simulators** (e.g., SUPREME) model how manufacturing conditions affect device characteristics.

   - **Circuit simulators** (e.g., SPICE, Spectre) predict circuit behavior like voltages, currents, performance, and power.

   - **Logic simulators** (e.g., VCS, ModelSim) verify correct operation of digital designs described in HDL.

   - **Architecture simulators** analyze instruction-level behavior to guide decisions on pipelining, memory, and performance.
- The purpose of SPICE simulations is to **analyze, verify, and understand** the behavior of electrical and electronic circuits **before physically building them**.
  
ðŸ‘‰ In short, simulation tools enable accurate, low-cost design verification across all stages of IC development.

- A **circuit simulator** uses an input file that includes:

    - A **netlist** describing circuit components and their connections (manually written or extracted from CAD tools).

    - **Device models** and parameters defining component behavior.

    - The circuitâ€™s **initial conditions**.

    - **Stimulus inputs** applied to the circuit.

    - **Simulation options and analysis commands** specifying the type of simulation to perform.

ðŸ‘‰ In short, the simulator needs the circuitâ€™s structure, device behavior, initial state, inputs, and simulation settings to analyze circuit performance.

## **Analysis Types supported by SPICE:**
| Analysis Type | Details |
|:---|:---|
| DC Analysis | Find the DC operating point of the circuit i.e., all voltages and currents |
| AC Small-Signal Analysis | AC analysis is limited to analog nodes and represents the small signal, sinusoidal solution of the analog system described at a particular frequency or set of frequencies.
| Transient Analysis | Transient analysis is an extension of DC analysis to the time domain. In other words, it solves a DC Analysis for each timestep based on initial conditions. |
| Pole-Zero Analysis | Computes the poles and/or zeros in the small-signal ac transfer function. |
| Small-Signal Distortion Analysis | Computes steady-state harmonic and intermodulation products for small input signal magnitudes. |
| Sensitivity Analysis | Calculate either the DC operating-point sensitivity or the AC small-signal sensitivity of an output variable with respect to all circuit variables, including model parameters. |
| Noise Analysis | Measures the device-generated noise for a given circuit. |

### Transistor operation
- When no gate voltage is applied, the MOSFET is in the cut-off region with no conduction between source and drain.
- As the gate-to-source voltage (VGS) increases, minority carriers form a conductive channel under the gate.
- At a specific voltage called the threshold voltage (VT), surface inversion occurs â€” the minority carrier concentration in the channel equals the majority carrier concentration in the substrate, enabling current flow.
- When the gate-to-source voltage (VGS) increases several thermal voltages (Î¦t) beyond the threshold voltage, the MOSFET enters the strong inversion region.
- In this region, the channel is well-formed, and the minority carrier concentration becomes strongly dependent on the gate voltage, allowing significant current flow.

### Effect of Substrate/body bias on Threshold voltage
- The effect of substrate (body) bias on threshold voltage is known as the body effect.
- In an NMOS transistor, when the source-to-body voltage (VSB) increases (i.e., the body becomes more negatively biased relative to the source):
- The sourceâ€“body junction becomes more reverse-biased.
- It becomes harder to form the inversion layer (channel).
- Therefore, a higher gate-to-source voltage (VGS) is needed to turn the transistor on.

ðŸ‘‰ Result: The threshold voltage (VT) increases with increasing VSB.

ðŸ‘‰ In short, Increasing body bias (VSB) â†’ increases threshold voltage â†’ reduces transistor drive current.

## Resistive/Linear/Triode Region of operation
Let us analyse the condition when we apply a Gate-Source potential, $V_{GS} >= V_{TH}$ and a small value of $V_{DS}$ is applied across the channel from Drain-to-Source.

## Derivation of Drain-current Equation
Using a first-order analysis, the drain current (ID) in a MOSFET arises from the drift of charge carriers in the channel, caused by the lateral electric field established by the applied drain-to-source voltage (VDS)

<img width="840" height="426" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a820d21f-b738-4adb-9b5f-e86ce30a80bb" />

  - Let $V_{GS}$ be held constant at a value greater than $V_{TH}$.  
  - The applied $V_{DS}$ appears as a voltage drop across the length of the channel.  
  - As we travel along the channel from Source to Drain, the voltage (measured relative to the Source terminal) increases from zero to $V_{DS}$.
  - Thus the voltage between the gate and points along the channel decreases from $V_{GS}$ at the Source end to $V_{GD} = V_{GS}-V_{DS}$ at the Drain end.


  - At a point x along the channel, the voltage is $V(x)$, and the gate-to-channel voltage at that point equals $V_{GS} â€“ V(x)$.

Under the assumption that this voltage exceeds the threshold voltage all along the channel, the induced channel charge per unit area at point x can be computed.

$Q_i(x) = -C_{ox} [V_{GS} - V(x) -V_{TH}]$  
$where:$  
$~~~~~~~~ C_{ox} = \dfrac{\epsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}}$

The current is given as the product of the drift velocity of the carriers, $v_n$ and the
available charge. Due to charge conservation, it is a constant over the length of the channel.
W is the width of the channel in a direction perpendicular to the current flow.

$I_D = -v_n(x) * Q_i(x) * W$

The electron velocity is related to the electric field through a parameter called the mobility $\mu_n$ (expressed in $\dfrac{m^2}{V.s}$).  

Drift velocity, $v_n = -\mu_n \dfrac{dV}{dx}$

$\therefore I_D = -\mu_n \dfrac{dV}{dx} * -C_{ox} [V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{TH}] * W$  

$i.e., I_D dx = \mu_n C_{ox} W [V_{GS} - V(x) -V_{TH}] dV$

Integrating the equation over the length of the channel L yields the voltage-current relation of the transistor:  
$\boxed{I_D = {k_n}^\prime \dfrac{W}{L} \left[ (V_{GS}-V_{TH})V_{DS} - \dfrac{{V_{DS}}^2}{2} \right]
     = k_n \left[ (V_{GS}-V_{TH})V_{DS} - \dfrac{{V_{DS}}^2}{2} \right]}$

$where:$  
$~~~~~~~~ {k_n}^\prime$ is the _process transconductance parameter._  
$~~~~~~~~ {k_n}^\prime = \mu_nC_{ox}$

The product of process transconductance, ${k_n}^\prime$ and the $\dfrac{W}{L}$ ratio of the transistor is called the _gain factor_, $k_n$ of the device.

$~~~~~~~~ k_n = {k_n}^\prime * \left( \dfrac{W}{L} \right)$

Now, the above equation for Drain Current:  
$I_D = k_n * \left[(V_{GS} - V_{TH}) * V_{DS} - \dfrac{V_{DS}^2}{2}\right]$
is a quadratic function of $V_{DS}$.  

But at low values, the $\dfrac{V_{DS}^2}{2}$ term can be ignored as it is close to zero. Hence the equation for $I_D$ can be approximated to be a linear function of $V_{DS}$:  

$\boxed {i.e., I_D = k_n * (V_{GS} - V_{TH}) * V_{DS}} ~~~~ $
_Hence the name Linear Region_

## Saturation/Pinch-off region of Operation
When a **VDS** is applied, the **channel voltage** varies along its length, causing the **channel-depth** to be **non-uniform**.
  - The channel is **deepest** at the source, proportional to $\boxed { V_{GS} - V_{TH}} ~~~~ $
  - It is **shallowest** at the drain, proportional to $\boxed { V_{GS} - V_{TH} - V_{DS}} ~~~~ $
    
âœ…This results in a **tapered channel** shape from source to drain. 

### Pinch-off Region Condition
As **VDS** increases, the channel voltage at the drain end can drop to the threshold voltage (VTH), causing the **channel depth at the drain** to become zero.
- This condition is called **pinch-off**.
- It occurs when $\boxed { V_{GS} - V_{TH} = V_{DS}} ~~~~ $
- Beyond this point, the channel **disappears at the drain** and conduction is limited by pinch-off.

### Drain current Model for Saturation region of operation
<img width="564" height="374" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4087c6e-f3b1-4d4e-9db7-82e05fe4ba77" />

- When VDS exceeds
-   $\boxed {V{DSsat} =  V_{GS} - V_{TH}} ~~~~ $, the MOSFET enters the saturation (pinch-off) region 
- The channel shape and charge no longer change with further increases in VDS.
- The drain current (ID) saturates at:
    $\boxed{i.e., I_{Dsat} = \dfrac{1}{2} {k_n}^\prime \dfrac{W}{L} {\left[ {V_{GS}-V_{TH}}^2\right]}}$
  
- Pinch-off does not block current; electrons are accelerated through the depletion region into the drain.
- Any additional VDS appears across the depletion region, leaving IDsat and VDSsat essentially constant.

<img width="840" height="454" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8d96b80-b500-418e-81c8-045974e8268b" />

### Channel length Modulation and Finite output resistance in Saturation Region
- In ideal saturation, â€‹ID is independent of VDS implying finite incremental drain resistance.
â€‹- In practice, increasing VDS shifts the pinch-off point toward the source, reducing channel length.
- This Channel Length Modulation (CLM) causes â€‹ID to increase slightly with VDS
- The modified drain current is:

 $\boxed{\therefore I_{D} = \dfrac{1}{2} {k_n}^\prime \dfrac{W}{L} \left[ {(V_{GS}-V_{TH}}^2\right] (1 + \lambda V_{DS})}$

â€‹Î» is the CLM parameter, dependent on process and channel length.
- The output resistance becomes finite:
    $r_o = \dfrac{1}{\lambda I_D}$ 

âœ… CLM explains why saturated MOSFETs have slightly rising current and finite output resistance.
